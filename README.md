- 🌻 Hello, I’m Hannah(she/her). Welcome to my page!
- 🏥 Previously, I worked as a medical assistant and medical coordinator for 6 years before deciding to fully transition to software development! 
- 📚 I am currently a Turing student working towards my certificate in Front-End Development.
- 🐾 I have two mischievous, silly ferrets that I absolutely adore! They keep me company and steal my erasers whenever they're not sleeping for 14 hours. 🤪
- 💛 My hobbies typically includes swing dancing, traveling, listening to EDM artists, playing disc golf and volleyball. Turing is keeping me pretty busy so I've been using my free time to learn digital art. My favorite is making pixel art! 👾
- 🌱 Before Turing, I was just learning React and creating my first app. Now, I have more hands on experience working on testing with Mocha/Chai and E2E testing with Cypress. I am so grateful for all of the growth and learning Turing has helped me achieved thus far. 
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me on Slack @ohClaire or email me at hcelemen@icloud.com. I'd love to chat!
