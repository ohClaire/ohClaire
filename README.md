- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ohClaire
- âœ¨ I have two mischievous, silly ferrets that keep me company when they're not sleeping for 16 hours. xD
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in swing dancing, traveling, EDM music, and rock climbing.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and creating a Ferret app where you can select a ferret to race.
